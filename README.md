# Market

A practical project to learn ASP.NET Core, based on MVC architecture.

## General

Through the development process, I used:
- C#
- Razor Views
- Entity Framework Core
- Microsoft SQL Server Express
- Identity Authentication

Market is a typical idea for learning web-development which I implemented as my first real-world project with ASP.NET Core
